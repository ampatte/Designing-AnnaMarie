Professional Portfolio Project

*The purpose of this project is to challenge the class to create and deploy a live website using HTML and advanced CSS. 

*The project is to include a header and nav bar and sections containing a description About Me, samples of My work, and how to Contact Me.

*Live Deployed projects should have links leading to the project. There should be placeholders for empty spaces

*There was no starter code given with this assignment.

*Therefore this page is Made From Scratch!
